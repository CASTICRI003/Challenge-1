# Horiseon-Challenge-01

## Description
The point of this challenge was for me to understand how to read HTML and CSS. I added semantic text into the HTML to more easily read how it all works together. I also consolidated CSS items so that it all comes together.

## Installation
No installation required, I'm turning in the URL

## Usage
Not really much to put here. The links on page work as intended.
